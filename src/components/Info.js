            Easy Linavis: Simple Network Visualization for Literary Texts

            Easy Linavis (<em>ezlinavis</em>) generates CSV files with
            network data from simple segmentations of dramatic texts. In the
            <strong>left column</strong>, you can list segments (chapters,
            acts, scenes, etc.) and characters appearing or speaking in a
            given segment. Segments are indicated with a hashtag and they can
            be hierarchical, e.g.:
          </p>
          <pre>{'# First Act\n## First Scene\n### â€¦'}</pre>
          <p>
            This will automatically generate a CSV file with node-node
            relations (source, type, target, weight) in the <strong>column in
            the centre</strong>. Data changes as you type: as soon as you
            change something in the first column, the mid-column changes
            accordingly. The &quot;type&quot; column in the CSV file is always
            &quot;undirected&quot; here, but we inserted it so you can
            directly work with the CSV files in Gephi. The network graph in
            the <strong>right column</strong> is also generated live, using
            a spring-embedded layout, just to give you a first impression of
            what your network data looks like. To make it easier to understand
            how <em>ezlinavis</em> works, we provide some example files which
            can be accessed via the corresponding drop-down menu in the right
            upper corner.

            <em>ezlinavis</em> was developed by Carsten Milling and Frank
            Fischer, using the React and Sigma JS libraries. It is mainly
            meant for didactic purposes, although it could also be suitable
            to process simply-structured research data. We are mainly resorting
            to it in our workshops on network analysis of literary texts.
